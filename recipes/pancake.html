            <p>Refreshing buttermilk pancakes infused with a burst of zesty lemon</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)</li>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>Juice of 1 lemon (at least 2 tbsp)</li>
                <li>1 cup berries of your choice (fresh or frozen), roughly chopped</li>
                <li>Oil for frying</li>
                <li>Optional: chopped dark chocolate, chopped nuts</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the sugar and oil. Add in the eggs and mix well.</li>
                <li>Alternate the flour and milk until batter is smooth. Add the baking powder, salt, and berries. Stir through the lemon juice. Let batter sit for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Pour in a tablespoon of oil and swirl to coat the pan. Use a ¼ cup or ⅓ cup measuring cup to pour out the batter. For smaller pancakes, use a ⅛ cup. Fry as many pancakes as you can at a time, leaving a little space between them (this will depend on the size of your pan). Cook until the surface is covered with small bubbles. Then flip the pancake and cook very briefly on the second side. Remove from pan.</li>
                <li>Repeat, adding a new tablespoon of oil each time, until all the batter has been used.</li>
            </ol>
