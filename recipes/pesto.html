        <h2>Basil Pesto Pasta with White Cheese</h2>
        <div class="main-ingredients">
            <p>Homemade basil pesto twirled with pasta and finished with a sprinkle of creamy white cheese - a symphony of fresh flavors.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 lb. pasta(shape of your choice)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup basil pesto</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil the pasta according to the packet directions. Aim for al dente. Reserve Â¼ cup of the pasta water before draining.</li>
                    <li>Immediately mix in the pesto. Add half the pasta reserved water while mixing. If your pesto is very thick, add the remaining a little more as needed. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Taste and adjust as needed. (Pestos vary in intensity and seasoning, so the additional seasoning you need will vary.)</li>
                    <li>Pour the pasta into a bowl and top with crumbled feta. Add a few grinds of black pepper over the top. Serve warm.</li>
                    <li>Optional: Add some cherry tomatoes, handful of baby greens (spinach, arugula), black olives, or other vegetables of your choice. Alternatively, you could flake a piece of cooked salmon over the pasta and gently mix that through.</li>
                    <li>NOTE: Refrigerate the leftovers and serve at room temperature within the next couple of days. You may need to add additional pesto and/or other seasoning when you take it out, because the pasta absorbs a lot of the flavor.</li>
